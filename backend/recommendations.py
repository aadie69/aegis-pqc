"""
Aegis PQC — remediation recommendation engine.

Translates an established finding and its Phase 7 quantum-risk conclusion into a
defensible remediation *direction*: what kind of change is appropriate, a
concrete target only where the mapping holds, and an explicit account of what
the evidence does not establish.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A pure downstream computation layer, like :mod:`backend.quantum_risk`. It
consumes canonical :class:`~backend.model.CryptoFinding` objects and
:class:`~backend.model.QuantumRiskResult` conclusions; it scans nothing, opens
no socket, runs no subprocess, and reads no file beyond the knowledge base
loaded at import.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not recompute risk or Mosca — those come from Phase 7 unchanged. It
does not rank, sequence, or prioritise — that is Phase 9. It does not invent
benchmarks; where no measured data exists it says so.

ROLE-AWARENESS IS THE POINT
---------------------------
"Replace RSA with ML-KEM" is wrong for an RSA *signature*. The engine keys its
mapping on the cryptographic role the finding recorded:

* key establishment (RSA transport, ECDH, X25519) → toward ML-KEM / a hybrid
* signature (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA) → toward ML-DSA or SLH-DSA

When the role is unknown, the engine does not guess a role; it produces a
conditional recommendation and names the evidence that would resolve it.

CAPABILITY IS NOT USAGE
-----------------------
A library capability finding yields ``USAGE_NOT_ESTABLISHED``, never a migration
recommendation for the application. The Phase 2/6/7 discipline is preserved:
detecting that a package *can* do RSA is not evidence the application *does*.

HYBRID IS NOT INFERRED
----------------------
The engine never concludes "this is a hybrid" from the co-presence of X25519 and
ML-KEM in one component. Phase 7 keeps those findings separate; Phase 8 keeps
them separate too. A hybrid *target* may be recommended for a classical key-
establishment finding, but that is a recommendation direction, not a claim that
a hybrid is already deployed.
