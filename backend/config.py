Chosen from measured data, not a guess. Pollard's rho is a RANDOMISED algorithm,
so what matters for a live demo is not the median runtime but the worst case —
you cannot have the pitch stall for ten seconds while a judge watches.

Measured over 6 trials each (single-threaded CPython, reference hardware):

    modulus     min      median     max        verdict
    88-bit    1.69 s     1.77 s    3.08 s      DEFAULT — tight spread, safe
    92-bit    1.22 s     1.81 s    4.40 s      acceptable
    96-bit    2.44 s     7.02 s    9.62 s      REJECTED — max is demo-killing

88 bits gives a factorization the audience can watch happen in under two
seconds, with a worst case that still fits comfortably inside a pitch.

Tuning guide if you want to change it:
    32 bits/prime ->  64-bit modulus ->   ~25 ms   (instant, anticlimactic)
    40 bits/prime ->  80-bit modulus ->  ~250 ms   (snappy)
    44 bits/prime ->  88-bit modulus -> ~1800 ms   (DEFAULT)
    56 bits/prime -> 112-bit modulus ->    ~40 s   (far too slow)

Never raise this above 48 for a live demo. Rho scales as O(n^(1/4)), so every
8 bits added to the primes multiplies the runtime by roughly 16.
