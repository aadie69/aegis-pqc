"""
Aegis PQC — Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM) generation.

Projects the canonical inventory into a CycloneDX-compatible CBOM using
``cyclonedx-python-lib``. This is a **downstream reporting layer**: the unified
inventory produced by the five discovery surfaces is the single source of
truth, and this module only serialises what is already there.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
A pure transformation. It reads :class:`~backend.model.CryptoFinding` objects
and emits a CycloneDX 1.6 document. It never scans a file, never runs a
subprocess, never touches the network, and never mutates the inventory. Given
the same findings it produces byte-identical output.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT
-----------------------
It is not a second scanner and it invents nothing. Three rules from the earlier
phases are load-bearing here and are enforced, not merely intended:

* **Capability is not usage.** A dependency finding with ``artefact_type =
  LIBRARY`` and an empty ``algorithm`` describes a library that *provides*
  cryptography. It becomes a CBOM ``library`` component, never an ``algorithm``
  asset asserting the application performs RSA. The distinction Phase 2 drew
  survives serialisation.

* **Unknown stays unknown.** A key size absent from a finding is absent from
  the CBOM. Nothing is inferred from a symbol name, an architecture, or a
  filename that the scanner did not already establish.

* **Weak evidence stays weak.** The ``confidence`` and evidence level recorded
  by the scanner are carried through verbatim as properties. CBOM generation
  never upgrades a LOW linked-library finding into a HIGH usage claim.

No quantum-risk conclusion, Mosca score, or migration priority appears in the
CBOM. Those are later phases; the CBOM represents observed facts and existing
inventory context only.

CYCLONEDX MAPPING
-----------------
Each finding becomes one CycloneDX ``Component``:

* An artefact with a concrete algorithm → a ``cryptographic-asset`` component
  carrying ``cryptoProperties`` (asset type ``algorithm``, primitive, functions,
  parameter set, OID, mode).
* A certificate finding → a ``cryptographic-asset`` with ``certificateProperties``
  (subject, issuer, signature algorithm, validity).
* A library/dependency finding with no confirmed algorithm → an ordinary
  ``library`` component, so it can never be read as an algorithm assertion.

Every canonical field that CycloneDX has no native slot for is preserved as an
``aegis:`` namespaced ``Property``, so nothing from the inventory is lost and
the mapping is fully reversible for downstream phases.

DETERMINISM
-----------
CycloneDX requires a BOM serial number and permits a metadata timestamp. Both
default to values that change per run, which would make output
non-deterministic. This module fixes the serial number to a UUIDv5 derived from
the ordered finding identities and sets the timestamp to ``None``, so the same
inventory always yields the same document.
