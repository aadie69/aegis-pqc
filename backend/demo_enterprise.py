AegisPQC — demo enterprise environment generator.

Builds a fictional organisation's cryptographic estate on local disk, so the
PQC readiness scanner has something real to scan during a presentation without
depending on finding certificates on the venue laptop.

WHAT MAKES THIS DEFENSIBLE
--------------------------
Every file this module writes contains GENUINE cryptographic material, produced
by the same library that secures real systems. The RSA-2048 key in
``api-gateway/`` is a real RSA-2048 key. The ECDSA certificate in ``mobile/`` is
a real, correctly-signed X.509 certificate. The ML-KEM-768 key in
``quantum-safe-service/`` is a real FIPS 203 encapsulation key in standard
SubjectPublicKeyInfo form.

That matters in front of a security-literate judge. The obvious question about
any scanner demo is "is it actually parsing that, or did you hardcode the
answer?" Here the honest answer is: it parses it. You can open the PEM files in
OpenSSL and get the same results.

DETERMINISM
-----------
The generated KEY MATERIAL differs between runs — RSA key generation is random,
and pretending otherwise would be dishonest. What is deterministic is everything
the demo actually shows: the asset inventory, the algorithm classifications, the
risk ratings, the readiness score, and the migration order. Those depend on the
algorithm and key size, not on the specific primes.

The environment is also generated once and cached on disk, so repeat scans
during a presentation return byte-identical results.

OFFLINE
-------
No network access, no external certificate authority, no cloud service. Every
certificate is self-signed locally. The generator works on an air-gapped machine.
