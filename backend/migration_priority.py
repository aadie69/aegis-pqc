"""
Aegis PQC — migration prioritisation and roadmap.

Answers the organisational question the earlier phases deliberately did not:
*given the context, which migration actions deserve earlier attention, and why?*

WHERE THIS SITS
---------------
Phase 7 said how quantum-relevant a finding is. Phase 8 said what remediation
direction is appropriate. Phase 9 applies organisational context — business
criticality above all — to those conclusions to produce an explainable
priority. It consumes the Phase 8 :class:`~backend.model.RecommendationResult`
(which already carries the Phase 7 risk level and Mosca status) plus the
:class:`~backend.model.ApplicationContext`. It recomputes nothing.

A DECISION TREE, NOT A SCORE
----------------------------
There is no weighted formula. Priority is assigned by an ordered precedence of
rules, each of which is a plain-language statement a reviewer can check. The
first matching rule wins, and it records the factors that placed the item where
it did. No risk conclusion is counted twice.

PRIORITY IS NOT RISK
--------------------
A CRITICAL quantum-risk finding is not automatically the top priority. The
IMMEDIATE bucket requires *both* that the finding is within the assumed
quantum-threat window *and* that the owning system is business-critical. A
within-window finding on a system whose criticality the organisation never
declared is HIGH, not IMMEDIATE — and the rationale says the criticality was
unknown rather than assuming it.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
It does not invent business criticality from an algorithm or a component name,
does not invent migration effort, cost, latency, or calendar dates, does not
turn "no migration indicated" into a task, and does not recompute Mosca. Where
an input is missing it says so. Nothing executes, opens a socket, or reads a
file.
